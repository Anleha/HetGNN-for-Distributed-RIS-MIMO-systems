This repository is an Pytorch implemetation of the Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model for beamforming tasks in disitrubted RIS-assisted multiuser MISO communication systems. 
The details of the model architecture and the simulation results can be found in the paper attached in this repository.
## Implementation
To train and test the model, run the notebook file: Distributed_STARRIS_HetGNN.ipynb

### Dependencies

- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
- [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/)
